# Deep-Matrix---Kaggle-Compition

This competition was conducted by Tinkerers codecell VESIT in collaboration with Kaggle.
It was a great learning experience as we studied various depths of data preprocessing.

The problem statement was to predict the employee attrition probablity and the number of years the employee would stay at the company.

We have used boxplots and coorelation plots to analyze the methods we needed to use in our feature engineering.

XGBoost and Gradient Boosting were used for data modeling purposes.
